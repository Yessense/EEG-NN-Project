## Neural Robot

We read brain activity using the Emotiv Epoc+ headset. Then we classify into 5 classes: forward, backward, left, right,
neutral. The output of the model is the control signal for the robot.

My contribution to the project was the idea, project management, the selection and implementation of the classifier on
pytorch, data collection, model training, the demonstration of the project at the open house.
